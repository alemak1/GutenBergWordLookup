After setting up the initial collection of words, myDictionary enters a loop waiting
for the user to type a command such as the following:
• find curiosity
Look up the definitions of “curiosity”.
• new webpage "1. ... 2. ... 3. ..."
Add a new word “webpage” with the definitions enclosed in the pair of double
quotes to the collection of words.

Count the number of words in the collection.
• quit
Exit the application
Be careful with illegal inputs. When the input is illegal, your program should be able
to report an error and resume the state of waiting for the next input.
